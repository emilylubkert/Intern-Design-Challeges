#NWEA Daily Design Challenge

I am an software development intern in the Future Impact and Growth team at NWEA, a research-based, not-for-profit organization that provides assessment solutions that precisely measure growth and proficiency. 

This work reflects collaboration between myself and the UX design interns on the team.
